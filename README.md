# nodemailer
This is a Node.js program which will send a mail 


Initially had some errors due to nodemailer and Node.js compatibility.Hence used old version of nodemailer and it worked as charm.
Then there was some login denied from gmail hence we need to enable it using https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1
. Then google will allow to use nodemailer to send mail automatically.
